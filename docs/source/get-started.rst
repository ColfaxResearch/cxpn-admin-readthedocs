Each section is organized to help you efficiently navigate and manage different aspects of our test drive program. The **Plugin** section allows you to configure settings specific to the portal, including but not limited to test drive duration, API configurations, and email templates sent to users.

The **User Registration** section provides tools for managing incoming user requests from registration forms, manually inviting users, and managing access codes for events and training sessions.

**Project Management** helps you oversee who has access to the test drive, along with any active reservations.

The **Infrastructure** section allows you to monitor your server assets along with their status.
 
**External APIs** provide documentation and logs for integration and troubleshooting.

The sections below contain detailed breakdown of each menu category and its key functions.
